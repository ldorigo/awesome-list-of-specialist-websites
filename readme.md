# A nostalgic [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re) list of Specialist Websites 

> Remember when the internet used to suck less (or more, depending on perspective)? Those were the days of blinking welcome messages, insufficient contrast ratios and dubious design choices. But most of all, those were the days where the internet was full of small, personal, weirdly specialized websites where the authors shared their passion for the widest variety of topics.
> This list aims to collect a few notable survivors from that era. If you're still confused about what we're talking about, visit a few of them and it'll become clear what we are talking about. And if you know some other gems, share them with the community!


## Contents

Note: For now, there are too few websites to be organized into sections. If this list grows as I hope it does, I will reorganize it.

[Sheldon Brown](https://sheldonbrown.com/) - Bicycle advice, from *how to shift gears* to complete bike overhauls. Incredible amount of details and often opinionated advice on how to do just about everything with your bike. 

[Floor Elf](https://floorelf.com/) - If you thought it wasn't possible to be passionate about tiling, you were wrong. Everything about tiling floors, waterproofing showers, and why failure in doing the above correctly may result in your dog catching fire. 

[Ask the Electrician](https://ask-the-electrician.com/) - You guessed it. Mostly about all the incorrect ways that you can wire things, and how to fix those.

[Piano-Ology](https://piano-ology.com/) - Don't let the somewhat fancy CSS fool you: despite a recent redesign, Frank Peter has been writing about music and piano playing for an eternity in internet-time. Besides the wealth of information from beginner to professional level, he has a warm way of writing and speaking that leaves you wishing you had him as a grandpa.

[Stick Site](http://www.sticksite.com/) - Everything you didn't know you needed to know about walking sticks and more specifically, diamond willow walking sticks. 

[RockTumbler](https://rocktumbler.com/questions.shtml) - Although technically a commercial website, it still qualifies as a specialist website for the sheer amount of information it has on rock tumbling. 

[SoftPanorama](http://www.softpanorama.org/index.shtml) - A _huge_ collection of articles about system administration, OSS and politics.
